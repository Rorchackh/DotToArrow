	Description
</h1>

<p>
	Old habits die hard hard. I understand that. 
	If you're coming to the PHP world from the your favourite programming language (say Java or C++), you might expereience a few issues.
</p>

<p>
	HelloPHP is a small <a href='http://www.sublimetext.com/2' alt='sublime text 2' target='_blank'>Sublime Text 2</a> 
	plugin made to help people who are new or not used to PHP syntax (like myself a few months ago). 
	<br />
	This plugin offers two simple features:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Automatically prepends the dollar sign to PHP variables
	</li>
	<li>
		Transforms the dot (.) sign to the arrow sign (->) for method and class variables calls.
	</li>
</ul>

<h1>
