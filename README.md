## Description

Old habits die hard hard. I understand that. If you're coming to the PHP world from the your favourite programming language (say Java or C++), you might expereience a few syntaxt differences that might annoy you. Namely, the arrow notation and $ at the beginning of variables.

<p>
	HelloPHP is a small [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
	plugin made to help people who are new or not used to PHP syntax (like myself a few months ago). 
</p>

This plugin offers two simple features:
<ul>
	<li>
		Automatically prepends the dollar sign to PHP variables
	</li>
	<li>
		Transforms the dot (.) sign to the arrow sign (->) for method and class variables calls.
	</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h3> Manual Install </h3>
